FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: /home/david/Documents/hyperbolic-core-periphery/edgelists/ecoli/ecoli_preprocessed.tsv
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 1565
Number of edges: 3632
Number of single edges: 3616
Number of mutual edges: 16

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

268399 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
270140080 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
270408479 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 14278614 tries were made, 10624749 were successful.
Randomization took 3.98333 seconds.
Enumeration took 109.278 seconds.
