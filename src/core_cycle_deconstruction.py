def chain_decomposition(G, root=None):
	"""Returns the chain decomposition of a graph.

	The *chain decomposition* of a graph with respect a depth-first
	search tree is a set of cycles or paths derived from the set of
	fundamental cycles of the tree in the following manner. Consider
	each fundamental cycle with respect to the given tree, represented
	as a list of edges beginning with the nontree edge oriented away
	from the root of the tree. For each fundamental cycle, if it
	overlaps with any previous fundamental cycle, just take the initial
	non-overlapping segment, which is a path instead of a cycle. Each
	cycle or path is called a *chain*. For more information, see [1]_.

	Parameters
	----------
	G : undirected graph

	root : node (optional)
	   A node in the graph `G`. If specified, only the chain
	   decomposition for the connected component containing this node
	   will be returned. This node indicates the root of the depth-first
	   search tree.

	Yields
	------
	chain : list
	   A list of edges representing a chain. There is no guarantee on
	   the orientation of the edges in each chain (for example, if a
	   chain includes the edge joining nodes 1 and 2, the chain may
	   include either (1, 2) or (2, 1)).

	Raises
	------
	NodeNotFound
	   If `root` is not in the graph `G`.

	Notes
	-----
	The worst-case running time of this implementation is linear in the
	number of nodes and number of edges [1]_.
